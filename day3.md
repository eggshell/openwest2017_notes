# Day 3

## Brewing Beer with Linux, Python and a Raspberry Pi (Chris Aedo)

* Mill the grains (mostly barley), break them up and put them in the mash
  (steeping in hot water to break down enzymes into sugars. sugars change with
  different temperature). Then heat up (sparging).

* Next step is to lauter (drain the sweet liquid called wort out), then add
  hops, cool it down and ferment the mixture with yeast, which eats up all
  the sugars pulled out in the mashing stage, which leaves you with alcohol,
  then bottle/keg it.

* My laptop died during the rest of the talk. Slides are available
  [here](http://localconspiracy.com/).

## Patents, Copyrights and Trademarks: Or Why the Future Might Curse Us (Deb Nicholson)

* Speaker works at Open Invention Network, a coalition formed to combat
  software patent trolling and related nefarious practices.

* "Intellectual Propery is a Lie", or putting patents, trademarks, and
  copywrites together is kind of a quagmire.

* Companies who have a large share of the market can carve out a bigger slice
  by suing smaller players out of the market with patent trolling. This is
  (obviously) a bad thing for the industry and wastes time/money.

* Case law is uncertain and does not change as quickly as the industry does.

* Trademarks:
    - Least impactful for free software right now, but that might change.
    - Intended to protect your reputation in the market by protecting
      symbols a company uses for brand recognition. Also helps to prop up
      customer expectations of consistency from the company.
    - An easy example is having the Oreo logo on their cookies. "Marks on
      baked goods".
    - A bad example recently is PlayDoh trying to trademark their smell as
      smell is incredibly subjective.
    - If you get sued for diluting someone's trademark, it costs tons of time
      and money to fight that.
    - "disparagement" can disparaging marks be trademarked? Examples are the
      NFL team in Washington, DC and the band The Slants.
    - Use our code but not our trademark? Pay attention to who holds the
      trademark in a shared project.
    - Have to walk a fine line between overzealous enforcement of your
      trademarks and doing nothing and letting your trademark dissolve.

* Copyright:
    - Originally applied only to books and other reading material.
    - We have this idea of "if you've written something, you own every single
      copy of it.
    - Is software instructions or a creative work? Seems to fall somewhere in
      the middle.
    - The problem is that it is VERY easy to make copies of software.
    - Recent examples are Disney exercising their ownership over Ursula, since
      they generally favor ridiculously long-term copyrights.
    - Another example is WarnerBros sending so many takedown notices for
      copyright violation that they have issued takedown notices on theirself.
    - Terms of Service and nobody reading them on websites can get people into
      trouble (Aaron Schwartz).
    - No recourse against an overreaching TOS.

* Looking ahead:
    - Copyleft, GPL license, etc are rejecting increased creeping scope of
      copyright.
    - Copyleft does have enemies (people using code outside of TOS).

* Patents:
    - ~20 years ago we decided to apply patents to software.
    - Originally intended to cover physical inventions.
    - Then it was applied to chemical formulas and pharmaceuticals. The problem
      here is that chemical formulas can vary slightly but have the same intent.
    - Extended further to cover business methods and software. Patenting
      business methods is problematic because it mostly stays in your mind.
    - Problem with notice and money again. You could write code that performs
      a function not knowing if someone else has already done this, what their
      use case was (and if it differs from yours), and ultimately who might
      hold the patent for that software process. Of course fighting a patent
      case is very expensive monetarily and time-wise.
    - Companies and venture capitalists are big fans of patents because
      they can protect ridiculous aspects of their products and control
      markets. If their product/company fails, they can sell patents off for
      profit.
    - FRAND provision for licensing usage of patented stuff. "Fair, reasonable,
      and non-discriminatory", but what is reasonable in the US might not be
      reasonable in India.
    - Trolls also like patents, especially old or vague ones. They are cheap to
      buy and can have an insane ROI.

* Looking ahead:
    - Read the fine print from your IP strategy lawyer. Don't be afraid to
      push back, and make sure you find the right lawyer for the job (e.g.
      get a lawyer comfortable with open-source if you want to open-source
      your software).
    - Join the Open Invention Network if you're doing open source and don't
      want to be sued.
    - Pick a license with a patent protection clause.
    - License on Transfer Network, Defensive Patent License, PAX and other
      community solutions.
    - Resist "law-making" without transparency and accountability (ex: TPP).
    - Garbage in, garbage out. Don't elect officials that don't understand
      tech at all. Call elected officials about tech issues.

## Lessons from an Old Software Guy (Kirk Haselden)

* Speaker has been a manager for 20 years or so. This talk is from his
  perspective rather than someone who is a boots-on-the-ground engineer
  currently.

* Keep an open mind to new ideas, approaches, platforms, and old ideas

* Be pragmatic (lose your religion) and use what works:
    - Align
    - Refine
    - Adopt
    - Adapt
    - Augment

* Avoid puritanical ideas:
    - The perfect scrum team/process.
    - X is the ONLY language for everything.
    - Waterfall sucks.
    - You must do X always!
    - You must never do Y!
    - PCs are so much better than macs!
    - There's only one way to do something.
    - C# is so much better than Java
    - Python is so much better than C#
    - Coke Zero is so much better than Diet Coke.
    - Agile **is** the answer to all of our problems.

* Own it and take responsibility for not just the coding, but for the entire
  product. It's about taking pride in the user experience and being embarrassed
  when bugs are found.

* Become a T shaped programmer (be expert in something, learn many things):
    - Leadership skills
    - Training
    - Cross-training
    - Become expert in something important.
    - Become competent in many things.
    - Teach others stuff, you will learn it better.
    - Make yourself invaluable.

* It's very difficult and stressful to do performance reviews on employees
  because it's subjective and personal.

* The "curve" and "nine box" performance review exercises are terrible, but
  typically the only tools managers have to rate employees.

* Interactions you have with your managers and peers are important because that
  is how they remember you and how they talk with each other about you.

* Get a mentor, here's how it works:
    - Mentee owns - YOU drive the entire process.
    - Mentor works for you, they are a resource at your disposal
    - Regular rhythm, establish a timeline for engagement.
    - Professional - don't waste mentor's time. Stay on task and message.
    - Focused - not a party or a friend. Serious engagement with structure.
    - Open - critical and essential that mentee is open and willing to change.
