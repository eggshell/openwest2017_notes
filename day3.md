# Day 3

## Brewing Beer with Linux, Python and a Raspberry Pi (Chris Aedo)

* Mill the grains (mostly barley), break them up and put them in the mash
  (steeping in hot water to break down enzymes into sugars. sugars change with
  different temperature). Then heat up (sparging).

* Next step is to lauter (drain the sweet liquid called wort out), then add
  hops, cool it down and ferment the mixture with yeast, which eats up all
  the sugars pulled out in the mashing stage, which leaves you with alcohol,
  then bottle/keg it.

* My laptop died during the rest of the talk. Slides are available [here](http://localconspiracy.com/).
